# SBPP - Simple Boris Particle Pusher
SBPP is a simple Python-based package used to integrate charged particle trajectories in user-defined electric and magnetic field configurations.

It uses the Boris algorithm in order to provide an accurate and fast way to investigate particle motions. 

It is intended as a modular set of functions to help undergraduate students with their research and education.

The package does not yet have complete documentation, but its basic intended functionality is complete.

SBPP was developed as part of my Bachelor thesis in Physics at the University of Groningen.
